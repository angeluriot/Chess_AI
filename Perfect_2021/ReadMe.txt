  Perfect 2021 opening book's release notes:
• Based on various short opening lines, played only same PC (in SCCT tours)
• Each opening is carefully hand tuned (it’s highly optimized for eng matches)
• The winning percentage of mostly openings (average): Whites 55 % / Blacks 45%
• These percentage values are checked by close in strength engines (3500+ Elo)
• Book’s Depth is mainly up to 8 moves (exc.a few lines are slightly deeper…)
• Includes very strong openings, recommended as same book for all engines
• I've spent almost 20 years for the optimization over the current openings
